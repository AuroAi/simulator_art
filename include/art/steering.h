/** Determine steering angle (in degrees) for a given speed and yawrate.
 *
 *   This computation is based on a simplified "bicycle model" of
 *   vehicle steering geometery.  We ignore the slightly different
 *   angles of the two front wheels, abstracting them into a single
 *   wheel at the midline of the vehicle (like a bicycle or tricycle).
 *
 *   Consider a radius from the center of the vehicle's turning circle
 *   to the midpoint of the rear axle.  The vehicle's wheelbase is at
 *   a right angle to this radius, since the rear wheels do not pivot.
 *   The hypotenuse of this right triangle is the slightly longer
 *   distance from the midpoint of the front axle back to the center
 *   of the circle.  As long as the wheels do not slip, the acute
 *   angle between the radius and the hypotenuse will be equal to the
 *   angle of the front wheel relative to the midline of the vehicle.
 *
 *   Thus, the tangent of the steering angle is the wheelbase (w)
 *   divided by the radius (r).  We estimate r from the desired
 *   yawspeed (y), assuming a constant velocity (v):
 *
 *    y = (2*pi radians) / (2*pi*r/v seconds)
 *      y = v/r radians/second
 *      r = v/y
